# Woofer
<!--quick description of application-->
Ready to find your fur-ever? Woofer is an image sharing platform designed to enable passionate pet lovers to discover pets of their interest. 
The process is simple, just like Tinder: to show your love, click on the check mark; not love at first sight? Click on the cross mark.
Adding a furry member to your family will change how you spend your time, your money, and you may even need to make changes to how your home is set 
up to accommodate your pet. So, if youâ€™ve already evaluated your decision carefully and are ready to adopt a pet, the next step is deciding what type of pet is best for you and your family.
